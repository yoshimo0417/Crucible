@5000 = ~Waves of sulfur and carrion fill the air and off in the distance you can hear the gate to the Demon Tower crashing open.~
@5001 = ~You feel the eyes of divine wrath upon you and hear a rushing of wings. Off in the distance you can hear the entrance to the Planetar Garrison opening.~
@5002 = ~You feel a tingling, like an awakening of a new aspect in your blood, upon entering this tower. Whatever it is, you know you are connected to whatever awaits.~
@5003 = ~The blood bowl is filled with the blood of Malchediel.~
@5004 = ~The blood bowl is filled with the blood Belchaad the Juggernaut.~
@5005 = ~The skull of Bhaal is filled and the path into the kingdom of Bhaal is opened.~
@5006 = ~You see what appears to be a sealed compartment in the skull of Bhaal. As of right now, there is nothing you can do to operate it.~
@5007 = ~Prominently displayed near Bhaal's throne is a lever of sinew, blood, and bone. It looks like you can pull this lever.~
@5008 = ~You pull the lever and hear the sound of ancient gears, grinding together. Off in the distance you can hear a door opening.~
@5009 = ~Before you lies the entrance to the Throne of Blood. One last fight awaits before your confrontation with Amelyssan.~
@5010 = ~With Mayithra defeated, you feel like eyes are off you and the attacks upon you in Khalas will lessen.~
@5011 = ~You cannot use this while in combat.~
@5012 = ~Well, it's been a while since I saw that amulet. Annoying as it can be, we should keep it. It may prove to be quite useful after all... Especially here.~

@5013 = ~Stepping out from your pocket plane, you see a vast and desolate landscape. The air is thick with ash and smoke, and the sky above is blacked out. Peering forward, you see a rugged mountainscape blanketed in a red glowing mist conveying an eerie beauty.

Suddenly, the realization hits you. This is not Bhaal's kingdom, but instead another plane of existence. Somehow your pocket plane was moved from where it was first created. You feel something tugging you forward as if Bhaal's essence within you knows where you are.

Before you lies a symbol of Bhaal, reassuring you of your surroundings. Off in the distance you can faintly identify a giant skull, and the essence within you confirms this is your destination. You feel an urging time is short, and you sense your essence stirring in the distance as Amelyssan prepares to ascend as the new Lord of Murder.~ [mobha178]
@5014 = ~Crucible~
@5015 = ~The statue intones: Any who dare cross the rune barrier shall be struck down.~
@5016 = ~You sense a great feeling of unease and danger. Something is not right.~
@5017 = ~You feel eyes upon you and know you are not welcome.~
@5018 = ~The runes at your feet are preventing you from progressing further. You will need to find a way to bypass them.~
@5019 = ~Stepping out from your pocket plane, you see a vast and desolate landscape. The air is thick with ash and smoke, and the sky above is blacked out. Peering forward, you see a rugged mountainscape blanketed in a red glowing mist conveying an eerie beauty.

Suddenly, the realization hits you. You are standing at the edges of Bhaal's kingdom, in another plane of existence. Somehow your pocket plane was moved from where it was first created. You feel something tugging you forward as if Bhaal's essence within you knows where you are.

Before you lies a symbol of Bhaal, reassuring you of your surroundings. Off in the distance you can faintly identify a giant skull, and the essence within you confirms this is your destination.

@5100 = ~I see you decided to finally arrive, <CHARNAME>. The hour is late and Amelyssan will ascend as the new lord of murder.~ //[mobha000]
@5101 = ~Where am I?~  // Player
@5102 = ~This is Khalas, isn't it?~  // Player
@5103 = ~Who are you?~  // Player
@5104 = ~Then time is of the essence, draw steel!~  // Player
@5105 = ~You shall fall as all have done before you. Prepare to die!~  // Player

@5110 = ~How you made it this far with so little knowledge is a question for the sages. You are in Khalas, the uppermost layer of Gehenna.~ //[mobha001]
@5111 = ~Very astute of you. Yes, this is the uppermost layer of Gehenna known as Khalas.~ //[mobha002]
@5112 = ~Isn't my pocket plane supposed to be connected to Bhaal's Realm?~  // Player
@5113 = ~Amelyssan suspected you had such a pocket plane when you first arrived in Saradush. Great effort was made to find and then sever your plane's connection from the greater Realm of Bhaal.~ //[mobha003]
@5114 = ~The ties are strong between your pocket plane and Bhaal's kingdom, so we could only separate them so far apart. We have since waited to see if you would make the attempt to come through.~ //[mobha004]
@5115 = ~Let us end this.~  // Player
@5116 = ~I tire of these questions, it is time for you to die.~  // Player

@5120 = ~I am a Deathstalker. Formerly a servant of Bhaal, I have since pledged my service to Amelyssan who shall become the new and rightful Lord of Murder.~ //[mobha005]
@5121 = ~Why do you serve Amelyssan instead of working to assit Bhaal's return?~  // Player
@5122 = ~I was one of many of Bhaal's Deathstalkers. A dutiful but unappreciated one at that. I serve Amelyssan as I will become one of her most favored and should reap the reward of her ascension.~ //[mobha006]

@5130 = ~No, I will move ahead to seal off Bhaal's kingdom and halt your advance. Kill the Bhaalspawn!~ //[mobha007]
//@5130 = ~Hurry <CHARNAME>, before I seal off Bhaal's kingdom and halt your advance. Be seeing you.~

// Deathstalker Second Convo (Eleven Labs)
@5200 = ~You arrive too late and the path is sealed. Amelyssan shall become a goddess, and I will be the one rewarded with bringing her your head.~ //[mobha008]

@5501 = ~I am a watcher of stone carved by Bhaal himself. What questions do you have?~ //[mobha213]
@5502 = ~How do I enter Bhaal's kingdom?~  // Player 1
@5503 = ~How do I enter the structures you mention?~  // Player 1
@5504 = ~I have no further questions.~  // Player 1
@5510 = ~To enter Bhaal's palace, sacrifices in blood must be made.~ //[mobha214]
@5511 = ~You will need to defeat and draw the blood from the masters of the Towers to the East and the West.~ //[mobha215]
@5512 = ~The bowls before the bridge need to be filled with their blood. The final step will be sacrificing your own blood.~ //[mobha216]
@5513 = ~This will require a substantial amount, so you best ensure you prepare so the process doesn't kill you.~ //[mobha217]
@5520 = ~A heart of the most foul hatred must be placed within the Eastern skull pile while a feather of one fallen from grace needs to be placed within the Western skull pile.~ //[mobha218]
//@5521 = ~The Feather of a Fallen Planetar must be placed within the Western skull pile.~
@5522 = ~Beware! These actions will alert the denizens that inhabit these locations and bring swift condemnation. Prepare yourself accordingly.~ //[mobha219]

// Sapphira (Lilith - Angry)
@5600 = ~You dare breach our sanctum?!~ //[mobha021]
@5601 = ~Wait...you are Bhaalspawn.~ //[mobha023]
@5602 = ~Do you have the slightest idea of the true power hidden within your blood?~ //[mobha024]
@5603 = ~I felt something else when I entered this place. What else besides Bhaal would exist?~  // Player1
@5604 = ~Bhaal's essence, of course.~  // Player1
@5605 = ~Enough chatter, demon. Time to die.~  // Player1

@5610 = ~Interesting, you do feel it. Perhaps it resides stronger in you than your kin.~ //[mobha025]
@5611 = ~Arrogant and naive you are.~ //[mobha026]
@5612 = ~Bhaal was born mortal. How do you think he became a god?~ //[mobha027]
@5613 = ~Bhaal, along with Bane and Myrkul were known as the Dark Three. Together, they assaulted the Castle of Bone and confronted the god Jergal who willingly stepped aside. Bane became the god of hatred, strife, and tyranny, Myrkul took reign over the dead, and Bhaal became the Lord of Murder.~  // Player 1
@5614 = ~Didn't he take it from Jergal?~  // Player1
// Enough chatter, demon. Time to die.

@5620 = ~Very astute of you, but that is only a fraction of it.~ //[mobha028]
@5621 = ~Yes, the Dark Three consisting of Bane, Myrkul, and your father Bhaal forged a pact to achieve godhood, or die trying. With their pact, they turned their focus on Jergal, Lord of the End of Everything.~ //[mobha029]
@5622 = ~After much strife, their efforts paid off and Jergal willingly stepped aside and granted his powers to the trio.~ //[mobha030]
@5623 = ~Before confronting Jergal, the Dark Three first hunted primordials to steal their divine essences for themselves.~ //[mobha031]
@5624 = ~Known as the Seven Lost Gods, one after another they fell before the combined might of the Dark Three.~ //[mobha032]
@5625 = ~Five of the seven became servants of Bane, and one was supposedly slain.~ //[mobha033]
@5626 = ~The seventh became a servant of Bhaal and is the master of this tower. It is his essence you are feeling, and he is sure to want it back.~ //[mobha034]
@5627 = ~His essence will remain mine.~  // Player1
@5628 = ~A weakened god does not scare me.~  // Player1
// Enough chatter, demon. Time to die.
@5630 = ~Foolish mortal. Only slaughter awaits you here.~ //[mobha022]
@5631 = ~I shall feed on your soul!~
@5632 = ~Suffer! Weaken as I strengthen!~

// Belchaad the Juggernaut (Axorian - Menacing)
@5700 = ~You arrive.~ //[mobha035]
@5701 = ~Though Bhaal had many children, you must be first among them. Anything less and you wouldn't be here.~ //[mobha036]
@5702 = ~What are you?~  // Player 1
@5703 = ~I am not so easily frightened of a defeated god.~  // Player 1
@5704 = ~I'll do what my father failed to do, end your existence!~  // Player 1
@5710 = ~How your kind would choose to label me is no concern of mine.~ //[mobha037]
@5711 = ~I am divine. Until his defeat at the hands of Cyric, I was a servant of your father.~ //[mobha038]
@5712 = ~You, as your father before you, have defeated many a strong opponent prior to facing me.~ //[mobha039]
@5713 = ~Bhaal was with his companions, Bane and Myrkul, when we first met. Unlike you, they had an army behind them and had already consumed the divinity from six of ones like me.~ //[mobha040]
@5714 = ~Since Bhaal's death, I aligned with Amelyssan. Ending Bhaal's bloodline along with any chance for his resurrection will satiate my vengeance for the humiliation of my defeat.~ //[mobha041]
@5715 = ~Now mortal, I will take back my divine essence within you!~ //[mobha042]

@5720 = ~I yield!~ //[mobha043]
@5721 = ~You are stronger than your father was on the day he defeated me.~ //[mobha044]
@5722 = ~How do you wish to end this?~ //[mobha045]
@5723 = ~I will make the same choice as my father. I will take some of your divinity and you will serve me as you did him.~  // Player 1
@5724 = ~I will consume the remainder of your divine essence and end your existence.~  // Player 1
@5725 = ~I choose to end your existence.~  // Player 1
@5726 = ~Flee this place and know you are again a defeated being.~  // Player 1
@5730 = ~So be it. I will take my leave, my lord.~ //[mobha046]
@5731 = ~So, this is how it ends.~ //[mobha047]
@5732 = ~I do not know what games you play, mortal. I will take my leave.~ //[mobha048]

// Right Blood Bowl
@5900 = ~Before you lies an empty bowl with descriptions depicting vile, demonic entities and torture.~
@5901 = ~Pour the blood of Belchaad the Juggernaut into the bowl.~
@5902 = ~Leave the bowl.~
@5903 = ~The bowl is filled with the blood of Belchaad the Juggernaut and accepts your offering.~
@5904 = ~You walk away from the bowl.~

// Floor Symbol of Bhaal
@6000 = ~You see a pedestal appear before you with a place to put your hand. Instinctively, you know that upon placing your hand in the opening your blood will be drained to fill the remaining skull of Bhaal at your feet. Seeing the blood requirements for both Belchaad the Juggernaut and Malchediel, you know this will take a severe toll on you and you may not survive the process.~
@6001 = ~You place your hand in the opening.~
@6002 = ~Leave the pedestal.~
@6003 = ~You can feel your blood flow through you in torrents and the seal of Bhaal at your feet begins to fill.~
@6004 = ~You walk away from the pedestal.~

// Throne of Blood Transition
@6100 = ~Your destiny is nearly complete.~
@6101 = ~I am ready. It is time for the end.~
@6102 = ~I do not wish to leave at this time.~
@6103 = ~You step forward and embrace your destiny.~
@6104 = ~You take a step back to further prepare.~

// Malchediel (Rusty - Hatred)
@6200 = ~This is placeholder dialog.~
@6201 = ~Here is my blood to help with the testing. I will face you at a later time once I am given a proper fight sequence and script.~

@6210 = ~Impressive. Regardless of the odds you insist on pressing ever forward.~ //[mobha081]
@6211 = ~I have no choice but to press forward.~ // Player
@6212 = ~I am not a gambler and care little for odds.~ // Player
@6213 = ~Nothing will stop me from my destiny.~ // Player
@6214 = ~I shall crush any who stand in my way.~ // Player
@6215 = ~Yet, you blindly do so.~ //[mobha082]
@6216 = ~This is the great armory of Bhaal, known to house great and terrible weapons. In the years since his demise the armory has fallen in disrepair, so Amelyssan has assigned us to return it to it's former glory.~ //[mobha083]
@6217 = ~Much has since been looted and spread amongst the Realms, but some artifacts remain. Some of the most potent weapons are not made of steel, but instead are flesh and bone.~ //[mobha084]
@6218 = ~Awaken, Blood-drenched. It is time to arise and serve your master.~ //[mobha085]
// Cutscene summoning Uthaedeol

// Top of the Planetar Garrison
@6219 = ~I will not be defeated by you! Come to me, my servants!~ //[mobha157]
@6220 = ~Forgive me Jergal for I have failed!~ //[mobha158]
@6221 = ~You defeated the Uthaedeol?!~ //[mobha159]
@6222 = ~He posed a challenge, but was no match for me.~  // Player 1
@6223 = ~Fool, he joined me and will assist me in defeating Amelyssan.~  // Player 1
@6224 = ~Enough talk, I'm here for your blood!~  // Player 1
@6225 = ~I see. He was a true follower of Bhaal and will be dealt with once I am finished with you.~ //[mobha160]
@6226 = ~You exceeded the expectations I've set for you and must be killed.~ //[mobha161]
@6227 = ~I even collected one of your siblings to see what all the fascination with your kind was about. The chaos surrounding Saradush allowed my Planetar to swoop in unnoticed and collect your brother.~ //[mobha162]
@6228 = ~Tell me Viekang, should I worry about your brother?~ //[mobha163]
@6229 = ~<PRO_HESHE> must've defeated Yaga-Shura and his army to make it here. If <PRO_HESHE> could survive that, then <PRO_HESHE> can kill you!~   ////[mobha179] // Viekang
@6230 = ~A false equivalency. There is a vast difference between thinking one has power, like Yaga-Shura did, and actually having power.~ //[mobha164]
@6231 = ~Looking at your siblings, Viekang, you hold a marginal amount of Bhaal's essence. So little I don't think Amelyssan will notice it missing as she completes her ritual to ascend.~ //[mobha165]
@6232 = ~I have not been impressed by the amount and power of the essence within you.~
@6233 = ~<CHARNAME>, do you think your essence would be something of note compared to your sibling's here?~ //[mobha166]
@6234 = ~Power or not, I do not want the taint of Bhaal within me.~  // Player 1
@6235 = ~I have overcome much, and risen stronger for it. I do not know how much can be attributed to Bhaal and how much is from myself.~  // Player 1
@6236 = ~The amount of Bhaal's essence bestowed upon me is great, and I am first of my kin.~  // Player 1
@6237 = ~Then let us put your essence to the test and see how much power you truly wield.~ //[mobha167]
@6238 = ~Wait. What did Uthaedeol mean when he said you falsely claim to serve a master?~  // Player 1
@6239 = ~I suppose there is no reasoning and we must come to blows.~  // Player 1
@6240 = ~You know nothing of true power.~  // Player 1
@6241 = ~Gladly, I was ready for a fight as soon as I saw you.~  // Player 1
@6242 = ~May thy blade chip and shatter!~ //[mobha168]
@6243 = ~I was assigned to serve Bhaal shortly after he took Jergal's portfolio for murder. Jergal, rightly so, saw Bhaal as the most bloodthirsty and reckless of the Dark Three who replaced him.~ //[mobha169]
@6244 = ~Jergal directed me to serve Bhaal and keep his portfolio in check. All things need the proper balance, which is not something Bhaal chose to care about.~ //[mobha170]
@6245 = ~Jergal told you to serve Bhaal?~  // Player 1
@6246 = ~Did you serve Bhaal or Jergal?~  // Player 1
@6247 = ~Go on.~  // Player 1
@6248 = ~Only powerful deities can command Solar, like myself. Jergal is ancient, older than most beings in all the Realms. He commanded, and I obeyed.~ //[mobha171]
@6249 = ~I sense an aura around you from one of my kind. A powerful one at that.~ //[mobha172]
@6250 = ~Who do you think commanded the Solar to guide you from within your pocket plane? There are very few in existence who can make such a command, and Solar do not offer aid unless directed by a greater being.~ //[mobha173]
@6251 = ~I do not know who would command it.~  // Player 1
@6252 = ~How would I find out who commanded the Solar?~  // Player 1
@6253 = ~It doesn't matter who directed the Solar.~  // Player 1
@6254 = ~The Solar was as equally worthless to me as you must have been to Bhaal.~  // Player 1
@6255 = ~Simple. Either ask your Solar and hope for an honest answer or wait to see if the deity approaches you.~ //[mobha174]
@6256 = ~I grow tired of these delays, and wish to report your defeat to Amelyssan.~ //[mobha175]

@6404 = ~Speaking of survival. At first I didn't believe the reports you were traveling with Sarevok, yet here he is. How did you manage to do it?~ //[mobha074]
@6405 = ~It required an unconquerable resolve I doubt you are capable of understanding.~
@6406 = ~Says the man who died and is a shell of his former self.~ //[mobha075]
@6407 = ~Behind me lies the entrance to the Mana Forge where Amelyssan is gathering the collected essences of Bhaal. We will not allow you to disturb her plans.~ //[mobha201]

@6411 = ~Enough chatter, my destiny awaits!~  // Player
@6412 = ~Let's finish this. For Amelyssan!~ //[mobha077]
@6413 = ~You must be a fool if you think I would serve you over Amelyssan!~ //[mobha078]

@6521 = ~Nomatter how this ends between you and Amelyssan, my lord Bhaal will remain dead. I have nothing left now except to face the abyss.~ //[mobha057]
@6530 = ~I am first among Bhaal's Deathbringers and his most loyal servant.~ //[mobha058]
@6531 = ~A fellow Deathbringer walks among you. I see it in your eyes, Sarevok, you have been where I will soon be going.~ //[mobha059]
@6532 = ~It is not a place I would eagerly await going again.~ //sarevok
@6533 = ~I commanded a more militaristic sect within Bhaal's kingdom. Bhaal formed us during the Time of Troubles to deal with rival churches, but our strength was severely weakened when Bane slew many of our number so he could increase his power to challenge Torm.~ //[mobha060]
@6534 = ~After Bhaal's death, our mission and focus changed. In the years since, we have slowly been rebuilding our numbers so as not to draw attention to ourselves.~ //[mobha061]
@6535 = ~We were to become the tip of Bhaal's spear in taking back his portfolio from Cyric. That has now been shattered.~ //[mobha062]
@6540 = ~There was a coup with Amelyssan proclaiming herself to becoming the new Lord of Murder.~ //[mobha063]
@6541 = ~Her forces struck swiftly without warning nor mercy. In the chaos of battle, I assembled who I could of those still loyal to Bhaal and fled his kingdom.~ //[mobha064]
@6542 = ~We were hunted. You can see the aftermath around you of our last stand.~ //[mobha065]
@6550 = ~His kingdom is along the path to the West, but the entrance is most likely sealed. There is a statue near the entrance that Bhaal himself carved that may assist in opening the way.~ //[mobha066]

@6713 = ~Sorry, but I have more pressing matters that require my attention.~  // Player
@6714 = ~Pity. Well, please come back if you change your mind.~ //[mobha121]
@6715 = ~Powerful monsters. Dangerous monsters. I take some of the strongest in the Realms and twist them into something even greater.~ //[mobha122]
@6716 = ~It was commanded. With Bhaal set to be reborn, he was to have powerful entities at his side to dissuade other deities from interfering or outright attacking him while he is in such a weakened state.~ //[mobha123]
@6717 = ~I also suspect these to be the shock troops needed by Bhaal to assault Cyric's kingdom and take back some of his portfolio.~ //[mobha124]
@6718 = ~Haven't you heard? Amelyssan is seeking to ascend as the new Lord of Murder.~  // Player
@6719 = ~That would explain the commotion. We all play dark games, and I prefer to focus on my work.~ //[mobha125]

@6723 = ~Good luck!~ //[mobha129]
@6724 = ~That first monster did not fare as well as I hoped. Either you are really powerful or I'm doing really bad with my creations. What say you to a second fight?~ //[mobha130]

@6726 = ~Let's see how you fare against this next challenge!~ //[mobha132]

@6731 = ~You look barely singed from that last fight!~ //[mobha137]
@6732 = ~Well, I got one more I can throw at you, but it's a nasty thing.~ //[mobha138]
@6733 = ~You're either brave or stupid to go against this creation. I'm eager to see the results.~ //[mobha139]
@6734 = ~And just like that, my most powerful creation falls.~ //[mobha140]
@6735 = ~You have done as I asked, which is appreciated. Take this necklace.~ //[mobha141]
@6736 = ~You prevailed against my creations, and I am left but a humbled lich.~ //[mobha142]
@6737 = ~This was a waste of my time, and I will kill you for this!~  // Player
@6738 = ~Yes, I am a lich, but before my embrace of undeath I was a great spellcaster of the Netherese.~ //[mobha143]
@6739 = ~At this time, I was one of the Crown-Sorcerers of Rdiuz. Your father, a mortal known as Arabhal, was our chief assassin and spymaster. He was among the best spymasters in the empire and none, even as a mortal, matched his bloodlust.~ //[mobha144]
@6740 = ~We Crown-Sorcerers were as powerful as any within the empire; however, news brought by Arabhal of Karsus's Avatar was alarming. We pushed the magical limits within Rdiuz, perhaps even too far ourselves, but even we saw the dangers in Karsus' arrogance.~ //[mobha145]
@6741 = ~The decision was made. Arabhal and I secreted ourselves away as we planned to assassinate Karsus before he could bring his spell to fruition. Reports indicated Karsus could use his spell to strip the divinity from one of the gods, but it was to our horror he chose Mystryl as his target.~ //[mobha146]
@6742 = ~What happened next?~  // Player
@6743 = ~Please continue.~  // Player
@6744 = ~Didn't this cause Mystryl to sacrifice herself and cease all magic which resulted in your cities falling from the sky?~  // Player
@6745 = ~Enough with the history lessons, I have more important things to do.~  // Player
@6746 = ~Yes, that is correct.~ //[mobha147]
@6747 = ~Mystryl did what Karsus could not predict, sacrifice herself to protect the weave. All magic ceased and our cities fell from the sky.~ //[mobha148]
@6748 = ~Arabhal and myself watched in horror as our home plummeted to the earth. In but an instant, our empire came to an end.~ //[mobha149]
@6749 = ~After watching our city, our nation, our empire collapse before our eyes, we separated to pursue immortality on our own terms. Arabhal joined with Bane and Myrkul while I pursued lichdom. In the end, we both found what we were looking for.~ //[mobha150]
@6750 = ~An interesting story.~  // Player
@6751 = ~What brought you back here and into the service of Bhaal?~  // Player
@6752 = ~Bhaal found me. He was a new deity, and I was a fresh lich. He knew he needed protection having assumed the portfolio of the Lord of Murder and sought me out for my expertise in crafting magical items and weapons of terrible power.~ //[mobha151]
@6753 = ~This tower was erected along with the rest of his kingdom. Cespenar, a being willed into existence by Bhaal, was put in charge of the more mundane task of assembling items of power based on old recipes I created. My focus and endeavors was on creatures like the ones you fought.~ //[mobha152]
@6754 = ~Bhaal knew of the Time of Troubles. Instead of having me prepare to prevent his death, which he knew was inevitable, he wanted me to focus on preparing for his return. He wanted forces ready to keep him safe while he was vulnerable.~ //[mobha153]
@6755 = ~Not the results I wanted, but thank you for testing my creations.~ //[mobha154]
@6756 = ~You won't leave empty handed if you choose to test yourself against my creations, and you'll be rewarded with an expertly crafted item of power.~ //[mobha155]
@6757 = ~I'm old. I have known your father longer than most in the Realms. If you help with my testing, I can discuss our history.~ //[mobha156]

@6799 = ~I am still building this out. Please continue up the tower to progress.~

/*  This plays into mobha46x.d that was replaced with the above.
@6706 = ~No need to fuss, well, maybe a little. I'll be plopping you into that there battle arena for the first round of testing.~
@6707 = ~That did not go as well as I hoped. Either you are really powerful or I'm doing really bad with my creations.~
@6708 = ~Perhaps another test to confirm the hypothesis is in order. Are you ready? No? Well you're going back into the arena anyway.~
@6709 = ~I am still building this out. Please continue up the tower to progress.~
@6710 = ~Good luck!~
@6711 = ~Let's hold your feet to the fire!~
@6712 = ~You look barely singed!~
@6713 = ~Have *I* miscalculated?! Are my creations that far off?~
